(it is still serious, though.) your doctor should consider malaria as a possible cause of your illness. other common diseases with similar initial symptoms include dengue fever and typhoid fever.


  4            5.9898720830926955                         462.2 -- null-- the world is facing the biggest and most complex ebola outbreak in history. on august 8, 2014, the ebola outbreak in west africa was declared by the world health organization (who) to be a public health emergency of international concern (pheic) because it was determined to be an �extraordinary event� with public health risks to other countries.

 14               5.2862715734242                         989.1 -- null-- after a promising pilot conducted in one village during 2012, this model was expanded to 15 villages in the saraya health district during the 2013 malaria transmission season (july�november). fifteen comparison villages were chosen among villages benefiting from the original passive pecadom model. active case detection surveys were conducted in both the intervention and comparison villages to estimate symptomatic malaria prevalence at baseline, midline, and endline. at baseline, both sets of villages showed a similar prevalence at just around 1 percent. in the end, the prevalence in comparison villages was much higher than in the intervention villages, where only 6 cases of symptomatic malaria were found, showing great promise for this model.

 17             5.039157766176547                         413.4 -- null-- deadly human ebola outbreaks have been confirmed in the following countries: democratic republic of the congo (drc), gabon, south sudan, ivory coast, uganda, republic of the congo (roc), guinea and liberia. according to the world health organization, "there is no specific treatment or vaccine," and the fatality rate can be up to 90%. patients are given supportive care, which includes providing fluids and electrolytes and food.

 19             5.039157766176547                         602.1 -- null-- measures for the prevention of cholera mostly consist of providing clean water and proper sanitation to populations who do not yet have access to basic services. health education and good food hygiene are equally important. communities should be reminded of basic hygienic behaviours, including the necessity of systematic hand-washing with soap after defecation and before handling food or eating, as well as safe preparation and conservation of food. appropriate media, such as radio, television or newspapers should be involved in disseminating health education messages. community and religious leaders should also be associated to social mobilization campaigns. in addition, strengthening surveillance and early warning greatly helps in detecting the first cases and put in place control measures. conversely, routine treatment of a community with antibiotics, or mass chemoprophylaxis, has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.

 25             5.039157766176547                         650.2 -- null-- the world health organization, however, said one of its doctors who has been working in an ebola treatment center in sierra leone has tested positive for the disease. it said the doctor was in stable condition monday in freetown and will be evacuated. the state department said the doctor was from the u.s.

 27             5.039157766176547                         429.3 -- null-- public health officials choose how and when to quarantine people based on a combination of factors, not just transmissibility alone. if they are not quarantined, contacts might travel into another province or state. such travel makes it difficult to manage their condition or to perform further contact tracing. also, they might introduce the disease into a new area. (this happened in mali, nigeria, spain and the united states.) so, if someone has had a "high risk exposure" to a person with ebola, that person will be asked to take certain measures even if they feel well. they will be asked to stay at home, limit movements, and monitor their health for 21 days. public health officials will contact them daily to ask if they have any symptoms. mail and/or international shipping has not been implicated in the transmission of ebola. ebola spreads via direct contact with contaminated body fluids from a sick person.

 31             5.039157766176547                         608.1 -- null-- though a few cases of ebola in the u.s. and europe have sparked panic that the deadly virus is spreading far and wide, a closer look at the outbreak in west africa tells a slightly different story. the epidemic, which the world health organization reports has claimed at least 4,877 lives, largely in west africa, has so far been mainly confined to three countries: guinea, sierra leone and liberia.
