we have used a brief analysis of transport via cystic fibrosis (cf) transmembrane conductance regulators (cftrs) in various organ systems to highlight the importance of basic membrane transport processes across epithelial cells for first-year medical students in physiology. because cftrs are involved in transport both physiologically and pathologically in various systems, we have used this clinical correlation to analyze how a defective gene leading to defective transport proteins can be directly involved in the symptoms of cholera and cf. this article is a �staying current� approach to transport via cftrs including numerous helpful references with further information for a teaching faculty member. the article follows our normal presentation which begins with a discussion of the involvement of cftr transport in the intestine and how cholera affects intestinal transport, extends to cftr transport in various organ systems in cf, and concludes with the logic behind many of the treatments that improve cf. student learning objectives are included to assist in assessment of student understanding of the basic concepts.
