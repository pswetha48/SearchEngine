the ebola virus is particularly tough to combat because "once it gets into the human body, it attacks so many different tissues. ebola attacks every organ system, including the heart, lungs, brain, liver and kidneys. the virus even attacks a person's blood, thinning it and causing ebola's trademark bleeding from multiple orifices.the virus specifically affects liver cells and reticuloendothelial cells. affected blood capillaries leak fluids and plasma proteins, causing intravascular coagulation and a zero clotting factor. the water volume loss in the body produces clinical shock, thereby causing the organs of the body to fail. the incubation period is typically from two to twenty-one days, and, depending on the victim, symptoms occur fairly shortly after transmission. "all forms of viral hemorrhagic fever begin with fever and muscle aches. depending on the particular virus, disease can progress until the patient becomes very ill with respiratory problems, severe bleeding, kidney problems, and shock.
