the international response is beginning to get underway, but it is slow and uncoordinated. governments (including the uk and china) and various ngos have sent teams to construct new centers at different locations around the country, including jiu, port loko, and freetown. getting these new centers up and running is a matter of urgency. the need for more resources on the ground continues. community sensitization is an area of increasing concern. msf has been conducting training for organizations interested in joining the response. so far three international organizations have been trained in msf centers in bo and kailahun, with more trainings planned in the coming weeks.
