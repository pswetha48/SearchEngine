cholera is an important public health problem worldwide. although most cholera infections are not detected, large cholera outbreaks, such as those seen in haiti,vietnam and zimbabwe in recent years, can occur. industrialized countries have seen practically no cholera cases for over a century because of their good water and sewage treatment infrastructure. however, the causative agents (vibrio cholerae o1 and o139) continue to thrive wherever crowded housing conditions exist and water and sanitation facilities are suboptimal.
