the existence of asiatic cholera cannot be distinctly traced back further than the year 1769. previous to that time the greater part of india was unknown to european medical men; and this is probably the reason why the history of cholera does not extend to a more remote period. it has been proved by various documents, quoted by mr. scot,[1] that cholera was prevalent at madras in the year above mentioned, and that it carried off many thousands of persons in the peninsula of india from that time to 1790. from this period we have very little account of the disease till 1814, although, of course, it might exist in many parts of asia without coming under the notice of europeans.
