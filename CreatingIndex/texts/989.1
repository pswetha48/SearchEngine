after a promising pilot conducted in one village during 2012, this model was expanded to 15 villages in the saraya health district during the 2013 malaria transmission season (julyï¿½november). fifteen comparison villages were chosen among villages benefiting from the original passive pecadom model. active case detection surveys were conducted in both the intervention and comparison villages to estimate symptomatic malaria prevalence at baseline, midline, and endline. at baseline, both sets of villages showed a similar prevalence at just around 1 percent. in the end, the prevalence in comparison villages was much higher than in the intervention villages, where only 6 cases of symptomatic malaria were found, showing great promise for this model.
