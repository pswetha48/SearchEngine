cholera toxin has binding and enzymatically active subunits that activate the adenylate cyclase system of cells in the intestinal mucosa leading to increased levels of intracellular camp (11). the effect is dependent on a specific receptor, a monosialoganglioside (gm1), present on the luminal surface of epithelial cells. the a1 subunit of the toxin, once it enters the cell, enzymatically transfers adp-ribose from nad to the ?s-subunit of a stimulatory g protein (gs). when adp-ribose is bound, the intrinsic gtpase activity of the ?s-subunit is inhibited and the gtp-coupled form is permanently activated. once activated, the ?s-subunit of the gs attaches to the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase and leads to its continuous activation producing abnormally high levels of camp.
