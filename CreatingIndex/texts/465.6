ebola generally starts with flu-like symptoms. though it's known for the extreme hemorrhagic symptoms -- the bleeding out of the eyes, etc. -- not everyone will experience these. "in fact, only 20 percent of people will have [these extreme symptoms]" bhadelia said. "some people may succumb to the illness before it gets to that point, some may have minor bleeding, some may just have bleeding of the gums, or bruising."
