cholera is a diarrheal disease. people get sick when they consume food or water that has been contaminated by the feces of an infected person. the most common symptom is severe diarrhea. it is painless and watery (often called "rice-water" stools). vomiting is also common. most cholera infections are relatively mild. people recover on their own by keeping well-hydrated. about 10-20 percent of all infected people will suffer severe illness, which can cause life-threatening dehydration. these cases are treated with oral and/or intravenous fluid replacement and antibiotics. most travelers have a low risk of cholera, as following food and water precautions is usually sufficient to prevent the disease. healthcare and relief workers who travel to areas of cholera outbreaks and have limited access to safe water are at higher risk. they should consider vaccination against cholera. guinea cholera is endemic in conakry and forecariah.
