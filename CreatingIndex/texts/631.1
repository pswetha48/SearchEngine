scrub typhus appears throughout the asia-pacific rim. this disease is known for its diverse clinical manifestations and complications. there is no literature on the association of scrub typhus with adrenal insufficiency. relative bradycardia has been reported in scrub typhus during the febrile phase but not during convalescence. we report the case of a 45- year-old woman with scrub typhus whose blood pressure was persistently low due to acute adrenal insufficiency. adrenal failure responded to supplementation with steroids. she also developed sinus bradycardia during the a febrile period following treatment.
