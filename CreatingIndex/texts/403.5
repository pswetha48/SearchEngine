the case of nurse kaci hickox, put into quarantine on friday under a new jersey policy that exceeded precautions adopted by the u.s. government, underscored the dilemma that federal and state officials are facing. new jersey governor chris christie, who has defended his state's policy of automatic quarantine for medical workers returning from treating patients in liberia, sierra leone and guinea, told reporters he did not reverse the policy in allowing her to be discharged from the hospital and to return to maine. "we're very happy that she has been released from the hospital," said christie, who hickox had criticized for making comments about her health that she said were untrue while calling her quarantine unjust.
