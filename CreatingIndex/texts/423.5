travelers in outbreak-affected countries are being screened at the airports to look for signs of ebola and to find out if people have been exposed to ebola, even if they are not sick. those who have been exposed to ebola or are sick with symptoms of ebola will not be allowed to travel on commercial flights to the united states and potentially to other countries. screening at the airport may look different in each country, but you should be prepared for screeners to check your temperature and look for signs and symptoms of illness. you will also be asked to answer questions about possible exposures to someone with ebola.
