in montreal, between 3,500 and 6,000 irish immigrants died of typhus or "ship fever" in fever sheds in a quarantine area known as windmill point in 1847 and 1848. the immigrants had been transferred from quarantine in grosse isle, quebec. due to a lack of suitable preparations, typhus soon reached epidemic proportions in montreal. three fever sheds were initially constructed,150 feet (46 m) long by 40 to 50 feet (15 m) wide. as thousands more sick immigrants landed, more sheds had to be erected.
