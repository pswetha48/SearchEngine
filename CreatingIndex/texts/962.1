most people who live in areas where malaria is common have gotten some immunity to the disease. visitors will not have immunity, and should take preventive medications. it is important to see your health care provider well before your trip, because treatment may need to begin as long as 2 weeks before travel to the area, and continue for a month after you leave the area. in 2006, the cdc reported that most travelers from the u.s. who contracted malaria failed to take the right precautions. the types of anti-malarial medications prescribed will depend on the area you visit. according to the cdc, travelers to south america, africa, the indian subcontinent, asia, and the south pacific should take one of the following drugs: mefloquine, doxycycline, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or malarone. even pregnant women should take preventive medications because the risk to the fetus from the medication is less than the risk of catching this infection.
