during the first wave of cholera outbreaks, the strategies adopted by health officials were essentially those that had been used against plague. new lazarettos were planned at western ports, and an extensive structure was established near bordeaux, france (26). at european ports, ships were barred entry if they had �unclean licenses� (i.e., ships arriving from regions where cholera was present) (27). in cities, authorities adopted social interventions and the traditional health tools. for example, travelers who had contact with infected persons or who came from a place where cholera was present were quarantined, and sick persons were forced into lazarettos. in general, local authorities tried to keep marginalized members of the population away from the cities (27). in 1836 in naples, health officials hindered the free movement of prostitutes and beggars, who were considered carriers of contagion and, thus, a danger to the healthy urban population (27,28). this response involved powers of intervention unknown during normal times, and the actions generated widespread fear and resentment.
