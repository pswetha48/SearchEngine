the virus can even attack the connective tissues that are rapidly multiplying in collagen. collagen is responsible for keeping the organs in place, and the virus destroys and digests such tissues.it also causes blood clots in the bloodstream, so the blood thickens and the blood flow weakens. these clots tend to get stuck in the blood vessels, which in turn causes the red spots on the skin. as the disease progresses, the spots get bigger. the blood clots will also slow down the blood supply to most organs of the body such as the lungs, brain, liver, intestines, kidneys, testicles, and breast tissues. all these organs will become severely damaged and so, will eventually stop functioning.
