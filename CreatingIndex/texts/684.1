understand how the disease is spread. ebola hf can be spread in a number of ways, though primarily via direct contact with patients, specifically the blood and secretions of an infected patient. contact with objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles have also been linked to the spread of the disease.because the symptoms of ebola hf are non-specific and take a while to become severe, the spread of the disease to friends, family, and throughout hospitals is extremely common. in a healthcare setting, the reuse of unsterilized needles and the lack of proper hospital clothing has contributed to the spread of the disease near the source.
