prior to the 2014 epidemic in west africa, outbreaks of ebola virus disease were typically controlled within a period of weeks to a few months. this outcome was generally attributed to the fact that most outbreaks occurred in remote regions with low population density, where residents rarely traveled far from home. however, the 2014 west african epidemic has shown that ebola virus disease can spread rapidly and widely as a result of the extensive movement of infected individuals (including undetected travel across national borders), the spread of the disease to densely populated urban areas, and the avoidance and/or lack of adequate personal protective equipment and medical isolation centers
