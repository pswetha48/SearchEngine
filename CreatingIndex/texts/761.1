ebola kills a great deal of tissue while the host is still alive. the liver bulges up and turns yellow, begins to liquefy, and then it cracks apart. the cracks run across the liver and deep inside it, and the liver completely dies and goes putrid. the kidneys becomes jammed with blood clots and dead cells, and cease functioning. as the kidneys fail, the blood becomes toxic with urine. the spleen turns into a single huge, hard blood clot the size of a baseball. the intestines may fill up completely with blood. in men, the testicles bloat up and turns black-and-blue, the semen goes hot with ebola, and the nipples may bleed. in women, the labia turn blue, livid, and protrusive, and there may be massive vaginal bleeding. the virus is a catastrophe for a pregnant woman: the child is aborted spontaneously and is usually infected with ebola virus, born with red eyes and a bloody nose.
