there is no approved vaccine or specific treatment for ebola, and many people who get the disease die. therefore, it is important to take steps to prevent ebola. avoid nonessential travel to liberia, guinea, and sierra leone. practice careful hygiene. for example, wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. avoid contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen). do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected personï¿½s blood or body fluids. avoid direct contact with dead bodies, including participating in funeral or burial rituals.
