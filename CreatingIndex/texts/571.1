the modern world is now moving toward a full ebola quarantine. i personally recall flying home from europe in the 1960s while i was in the us army. the plane was diverted to the azores, and while it was refueled, the military passengers (mostly us navy submariners) were released into the azores for a few hours of shore leave. the commanders were not aware that a virus was loose in the azores. when we reboarded the plane and subsequently learned of the virus, we also learned that we would be diverted once we reached the us. we had to sit on a runway in rhode island and wait for the us health authorities to inspect the plane. they tested everyone on it and held us while they observed whether the virus had run its course.
