the current treatment for scrub typhus is administration of a tetracycline (most commonly doxycycline).[55] chloramphenicol is also effective, and macrolides have been used as well. relapses may occur if the antibiotics are not taken for a long enough period. intravenous (iv) antibiotics may be administered to patients who are seriously ill and unable to swallow pills.
