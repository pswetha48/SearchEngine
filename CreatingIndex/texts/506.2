the best way to guard against ebola infection is to avoid areas that have had outbreaks. those traveling to africa, particularly west africa, should first check the cdc's ebola website to see where ebola is present and avoid those regions. those who have to go to an area where ebola is present should avoid contact with infected people, wash their hands often, and not touch or eat wild animals (sometimes called "bush meat"). those working with ebola patients must wear head-to-toe protective clothing with no skin exposed.
