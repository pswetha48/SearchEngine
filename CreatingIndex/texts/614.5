for all strains except falciparum, the treatment for malaria is usually chloroquine (aralen) by mouth for three days. those falciparum strains suspected to be resistant to chloroquine are usually treated with a combination of quinine and tetracycline. in countries where quinine resistance is developing, other treatments may include clindamycin (cleocin), mefloquin (lariam), or sulfadoxone/pyrimethamine (fansidar). most patients receive an antibiotic for seven days. those who are very ill may need intensive care and intravenous (iv) malaria treatment for the first three days.
