among the five strains of ebola virus, the zaire strain appears to be the most virulent, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. despite extensive research, the molecular basis for this virulence has not been determined. however, this question came a bit closer to being answered thanks to the work of takada et al. [45]. they were able to demonstrate that the infectivity of the zaire strain of virus was markedly enhanced in the presence of mouse monoclonal antibodies, suggesting an antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (fig 8a). furthermore, serum samples collected from patients infected with the ebola zaire virus during the 1995 outbreak in kikwit, democratic republic of the congo (no. 2 and 6), enhanced the infectivity of virus in human embryonated kidney cells
