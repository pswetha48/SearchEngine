malaria parasites are injected into the skin capillaries (small blood vessels) by mosquito bites. from there the parasites travel via the bloodstream to the liver. here in the liver the parasites develop and multiply before entering the bloodstream again. in the bloodstream the parasites invade the red blood cells where further reproduction occurs. from there other internal organs like brain; kidney etc. can be affected as clumps of heavily infected red blood cells start blocking small blood vessels (capillary) obstructing the blood flow thereby causing interruption in the normal functions of the organs affected.
