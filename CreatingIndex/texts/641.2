treatment of malaria in pregnancy may prove to be difficult due to contra indication for use of certain antimalarials. chloroquine can be used safely in all trimesters of pregnancy. artemisinin is not shown to have any deleterious effects on the fetus in animal studies and therefore can be considered if the situation demands. quinine can be used in pregnancy, but one should be watchful about hypoglycemia. whereas mefloquine is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy, pyrimethamine/ sulphadoxine is contraindicated in the first and last trimesters. halofantrine, tetracycline and doxycycline are absolutely contra indicated in pregnancy. primaquine is also contra indicated in pregnancy, and therefore pregnant women with p. vivax malaria should be started on 500 mg of chloroquine weekly as suppressive chemoprophylaxis against relapse of malaria.
