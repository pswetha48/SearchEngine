two nurses who were involved in duncan's treatment were infected with ebola. one flew on an airplane to visit ohio and then back home to texas before she knew she had the virus, prompting hundreds of people on the flights — or who used the plane on other flights before it was taken out of service — to go into some form of monitoring or counseling. both of the nurses, nina pham and amber vinson, are now free of ebola and have returned to texas after being treated at specially equipped hospitals in maryland and georgia.
