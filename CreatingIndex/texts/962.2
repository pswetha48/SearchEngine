the types of anti-malarial medications prescribed will depend on the area you visit. according to the cdc, travelers to south america, africa, the indian subcontinent, asia, and the south pacific should take one of the following drugs: mefloquine, doxycycline, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or malarone. even pregnant women should take preventive medications because the risk to the fetus from the medication is less than the risk of catching this infection. people who are taking anti-malarial medications may still become infected. avoid mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing over the arms and legs, using screens on windows, and using insect repellent. chloroquine has been the drug of choice for protecting against malaria. but because of resistance, it is now only suggested for use in areas where plasmodium vivax , p. oval , and p. malariae are present. falciparum malaria is becoming increasingly resistant to anti-malarial medications.
