ebola has been exported from the three main affected countries in west africa to five other countries (nigeria, senegal, spain, the usa and mali). as long as case numbers in west africa continue to grow exponentially, more exported cases can be expected. in less developed countries, whether in africa or elsewhere, the weakness of health facilities and public health mean that imported cases pose a real risk of starting an epidemic. in developed countries, it is likely that health facilities will diagnose an ebola patient relatively quickly and public health authorities will undertake rigorous contact tracing, thereby avoiding a widespread outbreak. outbreaks were contained in this way in nigeria and the united states. certain behaviours place a person at higher risk for getting infected with ebola. some examples are caring for an ill person, preparing the body of an ebola patient for burial, and sharing a bed with an ill person. other risky activities include attending the funeral of an ebola patient, touching their bodily fluids, or handling or eating meat from a sick or dead animal. healthcare professionals caring for ebola patients face specific risks and must use proper personal protective equipment.
