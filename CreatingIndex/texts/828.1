ebola, like many viruses, works in part by inhibiting interferon�a type of molecule that cells use to hinder further viral reproduction. in a new study published today in cell host &amp; microbe, researchers found that one of ebola�s proteins, called vp24, binds to and blocks a transport protein on the surface of immune cells that plays an important role in the interferon pathway.
