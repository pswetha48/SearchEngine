cholera is an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium vibrio cholerae. an estimated 3-5 million cases and over 100,000 deaths occur each year around the world. the infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. approximately one in 20 (5%) infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. in these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. without treatment, death can occur within hours.cholera can be simply and successfully treated by immediate replacement of the fluid and salts lost through diarrhea. patients can be treated with oral rehydration solution, a prepackaged mixture of sugar and salts to be mixed with water and drunk in large amounts. this solution is used throughout the world to treat diarrhea. severe cases also require intravenous fluid replacement. with prompt rehydration, fewer than 1% of cholera patients die. antibiotics shorten the course and diminish the severity of the illness, but they are not as important as receiving rehydration. persons who develop severe diarrhea and vomiting in countries where cholera occurs should seek medical attention promptly.
