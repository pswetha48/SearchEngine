to determine whether they serve as reservoirs for v. cholerae o1, we collected aquatic animals typically eaten by humans, including shrimp, fish, crab, crayfish, and aquatic plants (n = 144) weekly during february 5�22, 2013. the samples were collected from 14 environmental sites. each sample was placed into a sterile plastic seam�locking bag and transported to the laboratory. one gram of the sample was mixed with 100 ml of saline and then homogenized in a sterile blender; 1.5 ml of the resultant mixture was enriched in 2� apw and processed as described.
