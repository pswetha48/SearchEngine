hepatitis b is caused by a virus that infects the liver. it is one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases affecting travellers and can cause either acute or chronic infection. about 90 to 95 percent of adults with acute hepatitis b infection will clear the virus on their own within six months, and develop lifelong protection against it. some people are unable to clear the virus, and develop chronic hepatitis b. untreated chronic hepatitis b can later develop into serious health problems. children under four years old are at particular risk of chronic hepatitis b, because only up to 10% will clear the virus.your risk depends of several factors: destination, length of stay, what you do when you are travelling and whether you have direct contact with blood or other body fluids. in certain destinations, your risk may be higher, as some areas have higher numbers of people with chronic hepatitis b in the general population. the risk increases with certain activities, such as unprotected sex, sharing needles, tattooing and acupuncture. aid and health care workers and anyone who receives medical or dental care with unsterilized or contaminated equipment in a country where hepatitis b occurs are also at greater risk.
