our treatment center continues to receive patients from outside of kailahun, as there are not enough treatment centers in the country. the patients are being transported from the heavily affected districts of bombali and tonkilili, traveling over eight hours by car, which is a serious medical concern as the conditions inside the ambulances can create cross-contamination and people are very sick. sometimes people travel for hours with a dead body next to them. we are seeing an increase in the number of households and communities under quarantine in the kailahun district, which is of some concern as it limits sick peopleï¿½s access to medical care.
