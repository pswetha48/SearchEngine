quarantine and other public health practices are effective and valuable ways to control communicable disease outbreaks and public anxiety, but these strategies have always been much debated, perceived as intrusive, and accompanied in every age and under all political regimes by an undercurrent of suspicion, distrust, and riots. these strategic measures have raised (and continue to raise) a variety of political, economic, social, and ethical issues (39,40). in the face of a dramatic health crisis, individual rights have often been trampled in the name of public good. the use of segregation or isolation to separate persons suspected of being infected has frequently violated the liberty of outwardly healthy persons, most often from lower classes, and ethnic and marginalized minority groups have been stigmatized and have faced discrimination. this feature, almost inherent in quarantine, traces a line of continuity from the time of plague to the 2009 influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 pandemic.
