scrub typhus is a mite-borne infectious disease caused by orientia tsutsugamushi (previously called rickettsia tsutsugamushi). it is distributed throughout the asia pacific rim, being endemic in korea, china, taiwan, japan, pakistan, india, thailand, malaysia, and northern portions of australia. however, cases also occur in the united states, canada, and europe, being imported by tourists returning from endemic regions. scrub typhus is manifested clinically by high fever, intense generalized headache, diffuse myalgias, and, in many patients, rash and an eschar at the site of the chigger bite. the diagnosis is suggested by the clinical history (including visit to an endemic area) and physical findings and confirmed by serologic testing or biopsy of an eschar.
