malaria is a dangerous and potentially life-threatening infection of red blood cells by a protozoan carried by mosquitoes. it occurs in some of the poorest areas of the world, namely parts of africa, asia, the middle east, and central and south america, where about forty percent of the world's population live. annually, 350 to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide with over a million deaths, mostly in children from sub-saharan africa. in 2002, malaria was the fourth leading cause of death in children in developing countries. treatment is recommended to be started within 24 hours after symptoms appear. several drugs are commonly used in the united states to treat malaria: chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine, atovaquone, atovaquone-proguanil, quinine, and doxycycline. a drug called primaquine helps to prevent relapses. these drugs are not benign. the side effects of chloroquine, one of the common anti-malarial drugs, can include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision and itching. in addition, it can worsen the symptoms of psoriasis and carries a risk of liver toxicity.
