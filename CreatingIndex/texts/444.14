evd in humans is caused by four of five viruses of the genus ebolavirus. the four are bundibugyo virus (bdbv), sudan virus (sudv), taï¿½ forest virus (tafv) and one simply called ebola virus (ebov, formerly zaire ebola virus).[24] ebov, species zaire ebolavirus, is the most dangerous of the known evd-causing viruses, and is responsible for the largest number of outbreaks.[25] the fifth virus, reston virus (restv), is not thought to cause disease in humans, but has caused disease in other primates.[26][27] all five viruses are closely related to marburgviruses.
