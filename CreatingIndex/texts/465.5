once the ebola virus makes its way into the body, it gets in the body's cells and replicates itself. "then it comes bursting out of our cells and produces this protein that wreaks havoc," bhadelia explained. the protein is called ebolavirus glycoprotein, and attaches to the cells on the inside of the blood vessels. this increases permeability of the blood vessels -- leading to blood leaking out of the vessels. "the virus causes derangement in the body's ability to coagulate and thicken the blood," she said. even people who don't show hemorrhagic symptoms will experience this leaking of blood from the vessels -- which can eventually lead to shock and, ultimately, death.
