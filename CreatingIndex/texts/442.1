ebola is not spread through casual contact; therefore, the risk of an outbreak in the u.s. is very low. we know how to stop ebolaï¿½s further spread: thorough case finding, isolation of ill people, contacting people exposed to the ill person, and further isolation of contacts if they develop symptoms. the u.s. public health and medical systems have had prior experience with sporadic cases of diseases such as ebola. in the past decade, the united states had 5 imported cases of viral hemorrhagic fever (vhf) diseases similar to ebola (1 marburg, 4 lassa). none resulted in any transmission in the united states.
