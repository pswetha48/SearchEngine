hbv is a large virus and does not cross the placenta, hence it cannot infect the fetus unless there have been breaks in the maternal-fetal barrier, e.g. via amniocentesis. still, pregnant women who are infected with hbv can transmit their disease to their babies at birth. if not vaccinated at birth, many of these babies develop lifelong hbv infections, and many develop liver failure or liver cancer later in life.23 sexual intercourse with multiple partners or with persons who have multiple partners can be dangerous. one should not judge by appearance: most infected people look perfectly healthy and have no symptoms of disease, yet may be highly infectious.high endemicity areas include south-east asia and the pacific basin (excluding japan, australia, and new zealand), sub-saharan africa, the amazon basin, parts of the middle east, the central asian republics, and some countries in eastern europe. in these areas, about 70 to 90% of the population becomes hbv-infected before the age of 40, and 8 to 20% of people are hbv
