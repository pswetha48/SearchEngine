one of the first tissues the ebola virus settles in is collagen. collagen keeps the body�s organs in place, like an organic glue. ebola eats away at collagen, causing all kinds of problems. the patient�s upper layer of skin ends up floating on a layer of liquefied tissue, resulting in tiny white blisters and red spots on the surface that can tear off with just a small amount of pressure. rips in the skin can appear and spontaneous bleeding can occur from several orifices, including the eyes, nose and mouth.
