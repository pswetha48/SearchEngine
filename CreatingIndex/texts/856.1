hepatitis b is caused by a virus that infects the liver. it is one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases affecting travellers and can cause either acute or chronic infection. about 90 to 95 percent of adults with acute hepatitis b infection will clear the virus on their own within six months, and develop lifelong protection against it. some people are unable to clear the virus, and develop chronic hepatitis b. untreated chronic hepatitis b can later develop into serious health problems. children under four years old are at particular risk of chronic hepatitis b, because only up to 10% will clear the virus. symptoms can take two to six months to appear. many people who are infected with hepatitis b have either no symptoms or only mild symptoms. symptoms of acute hepatitis b can include fatigue, loss of appetite, joint pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and dark urine. a small number of people will develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). some people develop chronic hepatitis b and most remain contagious for the rest of their lives. chronic infection may lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and/or liver cancer. most people with chronic hepatitis b are unaware of their infection. hepatitis b occurs worldwide. regions with higher numbers of people with chronic hepatitis b in the general population include parts of southern and eastern europe, south and central america, africa, asia and the middle east.
