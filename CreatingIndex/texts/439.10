the recent outbreak of the ebola virus has turned national attention on this deadly disease. named after the ebola river in africa, ebola hemorrhagic fever (ebola hf) affects humans and primates and has emerged sporadically since its first appearance in 1976. the virus appears to be native to the african continent (it has appeared in the democratic republic of congo, gabon, sudan, the ivory coast, and uganda). its natural host is not known nor is its mechanism for survival in nature.
