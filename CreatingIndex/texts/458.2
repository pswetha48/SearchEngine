no vaccine is available for preventing rickettsial infections. antibiotics are not recommended for prophylaxis of rickettsial diseases. travelers should be instructed to minimize exposure to infectious arthropods (including lice, fleas, ticks, mites) and animal reservoirs, particularly dogs and cats, when traveling in endemic areas. the proper use of insect or tick repellents or insecticides and acaricides, self-examination after visits to vector-infested areas, and wearing protective clothing are ways to reduce risk. these precautions are especially important for people with underlying conditions that may compromise their immune systems, as these people may be more susceptible to severe disease
