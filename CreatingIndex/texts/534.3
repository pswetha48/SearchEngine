the skin develops red spots, called petechiae, which are hemorrhages under the skin. ebola attacks connective issue with particular ferocity; it multiplies in collegen, the chief constituent protein of the tissue that holds the organs together. (the seven ebola proteins somehow chew up the body's structural proteins.) in this way, collagen in the body turns to mush, and the underlayers of the skin die and liquefy. the skin bubbles up into a sea of tiny white blisters mixed with red spots known as a maculopapular rash. this rash has been likened to tapioca pudding. spontaneous rips appear in the skin, and hemmoraghic blood pours from the rips. the red spots on the skin grow and spread and merge to become huge, spontaneous bruises, and the skin goes soft and pulpy, and can tear off if it is touched with any kind of pressure.
