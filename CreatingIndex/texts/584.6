the recommendations for malaria prevention include estimates of malaria risk to us travelers. these estimates are based on numbers of malaria cases reported in us travelers and the estimated volume of travel to these countries. in some instances, the risk may be low because the actual intensity of transmission is low in that country. in other instances, significant malaria transmission may occur only in small focal areas of the country where us travelers seldom go. thus, even though the risk for the average traveler to that country may be low, the risk for the rare traveler going to the areas with higher transmission intensity will be higher. for some countries rarely visited by us travelers, insufficient information exists to make a risk estimate. information about malaria species present in each country is based on the best available data from multiple sources.
