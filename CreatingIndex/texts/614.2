the primary symptom of all types of malaria is the "malaria ague" (chills and fever). in most cases, the fever has three stages, beginning with uncontrollable shivering for an hour or two, followed by a rapid spike in temperature (as high as 106ï¿½f), which lasts three to six hours. then, just as suddenly, the patient begins to sweat profusely, which will quickly bring down the fever. other symptoms may include fatigue, severe headache, or nausea and vomiting. as the sweating subsides, the patient typically feels exhausted and falls asleep. in many cases, this cycle of chills, fever, and sweating occurs every other day, or every third day, and may last for between a week and a month. those with the chronic form of malaria may have a relapse as long as 50 years after the initial infection.
