management of malaria before and after introduction of a treatment protocol at the eldoret district hospital. a prospective study on the management of suspected malaria using a protocol on a general medical ward during the months of february and march, 1992 was done and the results compared with those of a retrospective study covering the months of november and december, 1991. the retrospective analysis showed that 78 (65%) from a total of 120 patients received antimalarial drugs despite negative or absent blood smears for malarial parasites. in 41 (34%) of the 120 patients, the first line treatment given was quinine. in the prospective study the overall quinine use dropped sharply to 19% from 54% in the retrospective study. 94 (49%) from a total of 193 patients with suspected malaria had negative blood smears of whom only 8 (4%) received quinine while 63 (33%) did not receive any antimalarial therapy and 38 of these 63 patients ended up with different final diagnoses; the remaining 25 were observed on no antimalarial treatment and discharged home feeling well. these results emphasize the need for proper diagnosis of malaria and suggest that chloroquine is still acceptable and effective as a first line drug for proven cases of malaria in adult patients in eldoret. unnecessary quinine use is discouraged as the drug is more expensive with more toxic effects compared to chloroquine.
