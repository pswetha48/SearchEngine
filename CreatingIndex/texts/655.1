the incubation period, from infection until the disease breaks out, is generally less than two days, although it can be as long as five days. the infection is often a mild illness with ordinary diarrhoea, and it can even evolve without any symptoms at all. but the individual is still able to pass on the disease. typically, cholera begins over quite a short period of time with stomach pains without feeling sick. there may also be a mild fever. then vomiting and diarrhoea begins and may continue for several hours. this is followed by copious, watery diarrhoea that's pale and flaky and looks like rice water. the fluid loss may be as high as 1 litre every hour.
