louse-borne typhus is the only rickettsial disease which can cause explosive epidemics in humans. in the past, it was associated with wars and human disasters and it is still endemic in the highlands and cold areas of africa, asia and central and south america. cleanliness is important in preventing body louse infestations. the easiest control method of occasional infestations is to expose infested clothing to a minimum temperature of 70 degrees c for at least one hour. in emergency situations, it may be impractical or impossible for people to wash properly and fuel for heating water may be in short supply. in general, chemical control is required, especially where louse-borne disease threatens. two application procedures may be used: the dusting technique (individual and/or mass treatment) and treating clothing. in view of the spread of insecticide resistance in body louse populations, the choice of insecticide for a campaign should be preceded by a survey of insecticide susceptibility status.
