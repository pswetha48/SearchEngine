cholera is an infectious disease caused by a bacterial toxin that affects the absorption of water in the small intestine. in severe cases, it produces violent diarrhoea within only a few days. the dangerous aspect of cholera is the vast loss of fluid that can occur in a short space of time. it's particularly dangerous in children in developing countries. if untreated, the loss of fluid can be fatal within 24 hours of developing the disease. on the other hand, treatment is simple: replace the fluid with the right mix of sugar and salts ï¿½ water alone is not adequately absorbed. cholera is caused by a specific bacterium, vibrio cholerae. when an adequate quantity of the bacteria has passed into the stomach in food, they accumulate and begin to produce poisonous substances (toxins). it's the toxin that causes the symptoms of the disease. cholera is very common in parts of asia and africa, where epidemics occur at regular intervals. unfortunately, the 'el tor' cholera bacterium found its way to parts of peru in the 1990s, and from there, spread rapidly throughout the remainder of the south america. densely populated, poor areas with little sanitation and unsatisfactory food hygiene are particularly affected by epidemics.
