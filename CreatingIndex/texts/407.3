hepatitis is a general term meaning inflammation of the liver and can be caused by a variety of different viruses such as hepatitis a, b, c, d and e. since the development of jaundice is a characteristic feature of liver disease, a correct diagnosis can only be made by testing patientsï¿½ sera for the presence of specific anti-viral antigens or antibodies. in countries such as china, senegal, and thailand, infection rates are very high in infants, and continue through early childhood. at that stage the prevalence of hbsag in serum may exceed 25%. in panama, new guinea, solomon islands, greenland, and in populations such as alaskan indians, infection rates in infants are relatively low and increase rapidly during early childhood
