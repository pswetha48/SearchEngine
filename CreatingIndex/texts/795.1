according to the global polio eradication initiativeexternal web site icon, in 2013, 10 cases (1 case in 2014) were reported from the somali region of ethiopia. these are the first wild poliovirus cases reported in ethiopia since 2008. cdc recommends that all travelers to ethiopia be fully vaccinated against polio. in addition, adults who have been fully vaccinated should receive a single lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine. as of may 5, 2014, people of all ages staying in ethiopia for longer than 4 weeks may be required to show proof of polio vaccination when departing ethiopia. polio vaccine must be received between 4 weeks and 12 months before the date of departure from ethiopia and should be officially documented on a yellow vaccination card (international certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis). travelers should talk to their doctor about making sure they are properly prepared for any requirements they may face exiting ethiopia. because of the risk of cross-border transmission, cdc recommends a single lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine for fully vaccinated adults who are traveling to djibouti, eritrea, kenya, sudan, south sudan,* and yemen to work in health care facilities, refugee camps, or other humanitarian aid settings. this kind of work might put people in contact with someone who has polio.
