cholera hospital was established on june 24, 1854, at franklin street in new york city.[1] the institution was built to treat cholera patients who were denied admittance to city hospital in manhattan during an onset of the disease in the summer of 1854.[2] the mayor of new york, jacob westervelt, and the new york city commissioners, took control of the building at 105 franklin street in anticipation of an eminent cholera epidemic.[3] a few weeks afterward a second hospital for cholera sufferers was opened at a schoolhouse on mott street (manhattan). a book published by a new york physician in 1835 shows that a hospital called the duane-street cholera hospital existed in new york as early as 1835, but the relationship between the duane-street hospital and the cholera hospital at franklin street is unclear.
