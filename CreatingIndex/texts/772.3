several people have developed antibodies (or "seroconverted") to ebola reston,but did not become noticeably ill. still, it is too soon to assume reston is harmless in humans. �some people have seroconverted but we don�t really know much about that. all you can say is there hasn�t really been any human that has gotten really sick or died from it. but the �n� [number infected] is quite small.�
