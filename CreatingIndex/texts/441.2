the world health organisation has warned that the deadly ebola epidemic is �vastly underestimated� and that �extraordinary measures� will be needed to contain it. the deadly outbreak that originated in the west african country of guinea in february has already claimed over 1000 lives and spread to the neighbouring countries of liberia, nigeria and sierra leone. countries including india are bracing themselves to prevent the spread of the deadly virus by setting up screening procedures of passengers with a history of travel to ebola-affected countries. according to the health ministry, 9207 passengers have been screened for ebola since 10 august by airport health officers at delhi, mumbai, bengaluru, chennai, trivandrum and kochi.
