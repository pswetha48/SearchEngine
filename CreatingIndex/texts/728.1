cholera vaccine is not generally recommended, even though cholera occurs in afghanistan, because most travelers are at low risk for infection. two oral vaccines have recently been developed: orochol (mutacol), licensed in canada and australia, and dukoral, licensed in canada, australia, and the european union. these vaccines, where available, are recommended only for high-risk individuals, such as relief workers, health professionals, and those traveling to remote areas where cholera epidemics are occurring and there is limited access to medical care. the only cholera vaccine approved for use in the united states is no longer manufactured or sold, due to low efficacy and frequent side-effects.
