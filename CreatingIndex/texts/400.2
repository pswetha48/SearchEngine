the survival of ebola depends upon a host organism(s). humans are not the host organism - or natural reservoir - of ebola viruses. humans become infected when they come into contact with an infected host, although once humans become infected they can transmit ebola to other people. the identification of the natural reservoir of a virus is of great interest to scientists, because this knowledge gives information as to the geographic range and ecological areas where humans may come in contact with animals or insects that may be the source of the disease.
