cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium vibrio cholerae. every year, there are an estimated 3�5 million cholera cases and 100 000�120 000 deaths due to cholera. the short incubation period of two hours to five days, enhances the potentially explosive pattern of outbreaks. recently, new variant strains have been detected in several parts of asia and africa. observations suggest that these strains cause more severe cholera with higher case fatality rates. careful epidemiological monitoring of circulating strains is recommended.
