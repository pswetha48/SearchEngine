today, no country requires proof of cholera vaccination as a condition for entry. past experience shows that quarantine measures and embargoes on the movement of people and goods are unnecessary. isolated cases of cholera related to imported food have been associated with food in the possession of individual travellers. consequently, import restrictions on food produced under good manufacturing practices, based on the sole fact that cholera is epidemic or endemic in a country, are not justified. countries neighbouring cholera-affected areas are encouraged to strengthen disease surveillance and national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to outbreaks should cholera spread across borders. further, information should be provided to travellers and the community on the potential risks and symptoms of cholera, together with precautions to avoid cholera, and when and where to report cases.
