in the past, vessels flew a yellow quarantine flag if any crew members or passengers were suffering from cholera. no one aboard a vessel flying a yellow flag would be allowed ashore for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.[55] in modern sets of international maritime signal flags, the quarantine flag is yellow and black.
