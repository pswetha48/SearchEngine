is there a cure for the ebola virus? unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. survival is very low. research is geared towards creating a vaccine. however, at present time there is no available vaccine for this virus. the american citizens most recently affected have been treated with an experimental new drug, and have been shown to be recovering. this gives us hope for a definitive cure in the future.
