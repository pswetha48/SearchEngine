ebola virus infection is a rare but deadly virus that causes bleeding inside and outside the body. as the virus spreads through the body, it damages the immune system and organs. ultimately, it causes levels of blood-clotting cells to drop. this leads to severe, uncontrollable bleeding. the disease, also known as ebola hemorrhagic fever or ebola virus, kills up to 90% of people who are infected.
