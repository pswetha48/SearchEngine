rickettsioses are difficult to specifically diagnose, even by physicians experienced with these diseases. clinical presentations vary with the causative agent and patient; however, common symptoms that typically develop within 1�2 weeks of infection include fever, headache, malaise, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. most symptoms associated with acute rickettsial infections are nonspecific. many rickettsioses are accompanied by a maculopapular, vesicular, or petechial rash or an eschar at the site of the tick bite. african tick-bite fever should be suspected in a patient who presents with fever, headache, myalgia, and an eschar (tache noir) after recent travel to southern africa. mediterranean spotted fever should be suspected in patients with rash and fever after recent travel to northern africa or the mediterranean littoral. scrub typhus should be suspected in patients with a fever, headache, and myalgia after recent travel to asia; eschar, lymphadenopathy, cough, hearing difficulties, and encephalitis may also be present. patients with typhus usually present with a severe but nonspecific febrile illness. ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis should be suspected in febrile patients with leukopenia and transaminitis with an exposure history. most symptomatic rickettsial diseases cause moderate illness, but epidemic typhus and rocky mountain spotted fever can be severe and may be fatal in 20%�60% of untreated cases. travelers should be instructed to minimize exposure to infectious arthropods (including lice, fleas, ticks, mites) and animal reservoirs, particularly dogs and cats, when traveling in endemic areas. the proper use of insect or tick repellents or insecticides and acaricides, self-examination after visits to vector-infested areas, and wearing protective clothing are ways to reduce risk. these precautions are especially important for people with underlying conditions that may compromise their immune systems, as these people may be more susceptible to severe disease.
