malaria is a serious and occasionally fatal disease. it is caused by one of five different parasites in the plasmodium family, and is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. there is no vaccine available against malaria. chemoprophylaxis (anti-malarial medication) may be considered to prevent malaria. your risk is higher between sunset and sunrise especially if you participate in outdoor activities during this peak biting period. travellers staying overnight in rural or remote areas may also be at greater risk. you can reduce your risk by taking measures to protect yourself from mosquito bites, including taking an appropriate anti-malarial medication if recommended by a health care provider.
