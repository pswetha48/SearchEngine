with the complex nature and seriousness of the outbreak, cdc has created interim guidance for monitoring people potentially exposed to ebola and for evaluating their intended travel, including the application of movement restrictions when indicated. this interim guidance has been updated by establishing a �low (but not zero) risk� category; adding a �no identifiable risk� category; modifying the recommended public health actions in the high, some, and low (but not zero) risk categories; and adding recommendations for specific groups and settings.
