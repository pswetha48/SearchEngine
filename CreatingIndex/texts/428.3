another major factor in the ebola virus�s system wide attack on the body is its ability to form blood clots. forming small clots early on, the virus causes the patient�s blood to slowly thicken, resulting in a decreased blood flow. as the clots begin to get stuck in the blood vessels, the patient begins to exhibit external signs in the form of red spots on the skin. as the disease progresses, these clots and their tell-tale spots increase in size. another more serious effect of the ebola virus�s clotting factor is the decreased blood supply to the vital areas of the body such as the liver, brain, kidneys, lungs, intestines, testicles and extremities.
