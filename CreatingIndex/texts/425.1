so how is the planet doing? well, if we continue to overburden it with too many humans, cut down the rain forests, burn up all the coal and oil etc., we may expect also to unbalance the ecosystem that includes nasties like plague, tuberculosis, anthrax, cholera, typhoid, typhus, malaria, and viral hemorrhagic fevers with such innocuous sounding names as ebola, lassa, marburg, machupo, junin, and hanta (but hopefully not smallpox). viewed from the moon, earth indeed looks like a small, but beautiful islandï¿½an island that is our only home. maybe we should take better care of it before it develops a serious fever.
