the clinical manifestations of malaria vary with geography, epidemiology, immunity, and age. in areas where malaria is highly endemic, groups at highest risk include young children (6 to 36 months), who can develop severe illness, and pregnant women, who are at risk for anemia and delivering low birth weight newborns. in areas where malaria is transmitted throughout the year, older children and adults develop partial immunity after repeated infections and are at relatively low risk for severe disease. travelers to malarious areas generally have had no previous exposure to malaria parasites or have lost their immunity if they left the endemic area; they are at very high risk for severe disease if infected with plasmodium falciparum [1,2]. for this reason, it is important to consider malaria in all febrile patients with history of travel to malarious areas.
