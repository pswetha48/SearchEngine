the first coffin ships headed for quebec, canada. the three thousand mile journey, depending on winds and the captain's skill, could take from 40 days to three months. upon arrival in the saint lawrence river, the ships were supposed to be inspected for disease and any sick passengers removed to quarantine facilities on grosse isle, a small island thirty miles downstream from quebec city. but in the spring of 1847, shipload after shipload of fevered irish arrived, quickly overwhelming the small medical inspection facility, which only had 150 beds. by june, 40 vessels containing 14,000 irish immigrants waited in a line extending two miles down the st. lawrence. it took up to five days to see a doctor, many of whom were becoming ill from contact with the typhus-infected passengers. by the summer, the line of ships had grown several miles long. a fifteen-day general quarantine was then imposed for all of the waiting ships. many healthy irish thus succumbed to typhus as they were forced to remain in their lice-infested holds. with so many dead on board the waiting ships, hundreds of bodies were simply dumped overboard into the st. lawrence.
