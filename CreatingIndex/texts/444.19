ebola virus disease (evd; also ebola hemorrhagic fever, or ehf), or simply ebola, is a disease of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses. signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus as a fever, sore throat, muscle pain, and headaches. then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. at this time some people begin to bleed both internally and externally.[1] the disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 percent and 90 percent of those infected with the virus, averaging out at 50 percent.[1] this is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.
