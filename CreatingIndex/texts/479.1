traveller's diarrhoea is diarrhoea that develops during, or shortly after, you have travelled abroad. it is caused by eating food, or drinking water, contaminated by germs (microbes) including bacteria, viruses and parasites. other symptoms can include high temperature (fever), being sick (vomiting) and tummy (abdominal) pain. in most cases it causes a mild illness and symptoms clear within 3 to 4 days. specific treatment is not usually needed but it is important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid lack of fluid in the body (dehydration). always make sure that you visit your doctor or practice nurse for travel health advice in plenty of time before you travel.
