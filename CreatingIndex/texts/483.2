the clinical manifestation of enteric fever presents a diagnostic puzzle. most of the symptoms are non-specific and often mimic other infections even when complicated. indeed, the cognate, typhus, describes a very different infection, but nevertheless shares some similarities with the neurologic involvement and rash of enteric fever and thus the historical confusion between the two. both typhoid and typhus are derived from the greek word meaning stupor.
