most people who get ebola need intensive care in a hospital or other well-equipped medical center. treatment involves keeping them well hydrated, maintaining their oxygen and blood pressure levels, replacing lost blood through transfusions, and treating symptoms and complications as they come up. patients also need to be isolated from the public during treatment to help prevent the disease from spreading. some experimental treatments for ebola have been effective when tested on animals, but are not officially approved for use in people.
