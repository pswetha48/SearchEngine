the disease was first noticed among british troops in india, and vivid accounts appeared in the press of the effects of cholera in st. petersburg, russia. this first hand knowledge of the disease, and reports of the mortality it could cause in large cities, led the privy council to put all ships for russia arriving in england under quarantine in january 1831. the privy council had set up a central board of health in 1805, after concern about yellow fever arriving in britain. this was reconstituted, and met daily from june 1831 to may 1832. it issued circulars and gave advice to parochial vestry committees, who were responsible for the precautionary measures taken within their own parishes. as the disease spread west to hamburg, all ships from baltic ports were put under quarantine. those arriving in london had to spend 10 days in standgate creek, near deptford, before a doctor gave the ship a clean bill of health.
