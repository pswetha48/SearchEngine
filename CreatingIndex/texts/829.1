that's partly because ebola patients aren't contagious until they've started exhibiting symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. someone may be incubating the disease for a week or more without knowing it, potentially putting others at risk. and yet locking up everyone returning to the u.s. from the three ebola-stricken countries in west africa seems pointless if they can't pass on the disease anyway.
