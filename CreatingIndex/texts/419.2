while ebola poses little risk to the us general population, clinicians are advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of ebola in patients who have a recent (within 21 days) travel history to countries where the outbreak is occurring or have had contact with a person infected with ebola. in the event that a potential case is identified, clinicians should isolate the patient pending diagnostic testing.
