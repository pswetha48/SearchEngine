typhus is an acute febrile illness with more than one form. it is caused by rickettsial infection, which is endemic in many parts of the world, and is acquired via lice and fleas from other humans and small mammals such as rats, cats and squirrels (most commonly rats). there are two major types: epidemic typhus, and endemic (or murine) typhus. epidemic typhus is the more serious condition, which has historically been responsible for vast numbers of deaths, particuarly in times of war and hardship. today, if caught early and treated, it is not usually fatal. the rash of typhus is initially often described as rose-coloured, although this will only be its appearance on fair skin.[8] initially it is a blanching rash, although later as it reddens and darkens it becomes non-blanching. in severe cases of typhus, where haemorrhagic elements are seen, bleeding into the skin (petechiae) may be present.
