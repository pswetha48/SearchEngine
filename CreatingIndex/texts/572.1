of the 48 cases investigated by the central board before february, probably only one or two on the river were the asiatic cholera; the illness of john potts received the most attention, although it was only dysentery. he was a sailor recently arrived from sunderland on the collier mould, and waiting to work north on the dirt. taken ill with vomiting and cramps, he was removed to shadwell workhouse, where he soon died, on 18th january. a postmortem examination was performed, and a twenty-inch length of his intestines carried to the central board at whitehall by the parish beadle. the inquest was held in the george and dragon public house on shadwell high street, and was attended by representatives from all the neighbouring parishes, but the verdict was that 'the deceased had died by the visitation of god, from natural causes, and not from the cholera morbus'.
