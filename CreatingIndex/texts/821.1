about 5 to 10 days after infection, people with ebola get a fever, headache, and body aches. frequently there is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, chest pain, and sore throat. often there is sensitivity to light, swollen lymph glands, rash, as well as other symptoms. patients also begin excessive bleeding where injections are given. during the second week of infection, people with ebola may get better, but often they develop severe bleeding from many parts of the body. if this occurs, then the patient will probably not survive.
