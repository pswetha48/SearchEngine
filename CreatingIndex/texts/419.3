if you were exposed to people who had ebola, or their blood or body fluids, talk with a school administrator or student health center staff even if you do not have symptoms. they will tell you what school-specific instructions you should follow. a doctor should evaluate your exposure level and symptoms if you have them and consult with public health authorities to determine if actions� such as medical evaluation and testing for ebola, monitoring, or travel restrictions� are needed.
