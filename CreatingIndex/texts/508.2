chronic hepatitis b is a spectrum of disease usually characterised by the presence of detectable hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in the blood or serum for longer than six months. chronic hepatitis b may be inactive and cause no significant health problems, but may progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. the progression of liver disease is associated with hbv dna levels in the blood. although many patients with chronic hepatitis b are healthy carriers, some patients do have symptoms. these include fatigue, anorexia and nausea and right upper quadrant pain.
