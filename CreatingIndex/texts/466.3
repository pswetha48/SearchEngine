typhus is a group of infections caused by rickettsiae, a group of unusual bacteria. rickettsiae are like other bacteria in that they can be killed by antibiotics. they are also like viruses, however, in that they must invade living cells in order to grow. there are three main types of typhus: epidemic, murine, and scrub.
