because of the risk of cross-border transmission, cdc recommends a single lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine for fully vaccinated adults who are traveling to central african republic (car), chad, republic of congo, and gabon to work in health care facilities, refugee camps, or other humanitarian aid settings. this kind of work might put people in contact with someone who has polio. for travelers to the bordering country of nigeria, where polio remains endemic, cdc also recommends that all adults receive a single lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine.
