ebola zaire attacks every organ and tissue in the human body except skeletal muscle and bone. it is a perfect parasite because it transforms virtually every part of the body into a digested slime of virus particles. the seven mysterious proteins that, assembled together, make up the ebola-virus particle, work as a relentless machine, a molecular shark, and they consume the body as the virus makes copies of itself. small blood clots begin to appear in the bloodstream, and the blood thickens and slows, and clots begin to stick to the walls of blood vessels. this is known as pavementing, because the clots fit together in a mosaic. the mosaic thickens and throws more clots, and the clots drift through the bloodstream into the small capillaries, where they get stuck. this shuts off the blood supply to various parts of the body, causing dead spots to appear in the brain, liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines, testicles, breast tissue (of men as well as women), and all through the skin.
