ebola virus disease (evd) or ebola hemorrhagic fever (ehf) is a disease of humans and other primates caused by an ebolavirus. symptoms start two days to three weeks after contracting the virus, with a fever, sore throat, muscle pain and headaches. typically, vomiting, diarrhea and rash follow, along with decreased functioning of the liver and kidneys. around this time, affected people may begin to bleed both within the body and externally.[1]
