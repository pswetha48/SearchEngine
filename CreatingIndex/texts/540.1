malaria is an infection caused by single-celled parasites that enter the blood through the bite of an anopheles mosquito. these parasites, called plasmodia, belong to at least five species. most human infections are caused by either plasmodium falciparum or plasmodium vivax. plasmodium parasites spend several parts of their life cycle inside humans and another part inside mosquitoes. during the human part of their life cycle, plasmodium parasites infect and multiply inside liver cells and red blood cells.
