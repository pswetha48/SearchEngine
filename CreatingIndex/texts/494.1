relatives of ebola patients in sierra leone on saturday criticized hospitals for rejecting sick people and not moving fast enough to tackle the outbreak. earlier this week, the u.n. mission for ebola emergency response (unmeer) warned the number of ebola cases is surging in sierra leone because of a lack of treatment centers, while scarcity of food may also be forcing some people to leave quarantined areas, risking further spread of the virus. the warning came as sierra leone's deputy minister of health said ebola had so badly damaged confidence in the west african country's health system that many people were dying from other diseases as the sick refused to come to clinics for treatment.
