the symptoms of typhus include fever, headache, chills, and general aches that are followed by a rash. the rash spreads to most of the body but usually does not affect the face, palms of the hands, or soles of the feet. in murine typhus, the symptoms are similar but milder. in epidemic and scrub typhus, the fever may rise as high as 104 to 105 degrees fahrenheit and stay high for about two weeks. the headache is intense.
