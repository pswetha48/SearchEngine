if you travel to or are in an area affected by an ebola outbreak, make sure to do the following: practice careful hygiene. for example, wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and avoid contact with blood and body fluids. do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected personâ€™s blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).avoid funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who has died from ebola. avoid contact with bats and nonhuman primates or blood, fluids, and raw meat prepared from these animals. avoid facilities in west africa where ebola patients are being treated. the u.s. embassy or consulate is often able to provide advice on facilities. after you return, monitor your health for 21 days and seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms.
