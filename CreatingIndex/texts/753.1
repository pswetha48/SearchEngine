a 26-year-old indian man who recovered from ebola was being held at a quarantine facility at the new delhi airport as a cautionary measure after his semen tested positive for the virus, health officials announced tuesday. though tests of three blood samples came up negative, indian officials opted to hold him because the virus can linger in other bodily fluids, like semen or urine, for as long as three months, according to a government statement carried by the press trust of india. two samples of the manâ€™s semen tested positive on monday.
