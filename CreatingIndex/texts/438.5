the incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms is 2 to 21 days. humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms. first symptoms of ebola are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. this is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools). laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.
