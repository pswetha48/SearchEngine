the bizarre immune response during ebola infection is rightfully termed �paradoxical,� at once too slow, too little, too intense. the endothelial cells that curl into the tiny tubes that are the capillaries, and also line the interiors of larger blood vessels, contort into blobs. holes appear. barriers melt away, and the fluids that they contained redistribute. the still-crazily-replicating virus now has direct access to organs, favoring the adrenal cortex (plunging blood pressure), the kidneys, gonads, spleen, and most dangerous, the liver.
