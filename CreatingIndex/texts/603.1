prophylaxis is recommended for all areas below 1000 m (3281 ft) and for roat√°n and other bay islands. historically, the highest incidence rates have occurred in the swampy regions in the east, but the number of cases reported from the north has risen dramatically over the last several years. an increased number of cases was reported from the department of colon in march 2012. for many years, the drug of choice has been chloroquine, which is inexpensive and generally well-tolerated. the recommended dosage is 500 mg weekly, starting one-to-two weeks before arrival and continuing through the trip and for four weeks after departure. chloroquine may cause mild adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal disturbance, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and itching, but severe reactions are uncommon. other choices include mefloquine (lariam), atovaquone/proguanil (malarone)(pdf), doxycycline, or primaquine. mefloquine is taken once weekly in a dosage of 250 mg, starting one-to-two weeks before arrival and continuing through the trip and for four weeks after departure. mefloquine may cause mild neuropsychiatric symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, and nightmares. rarely, severe reactions occur, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, hallucinations, and seizures. mefloquine should not be given to anyone with a history of seizures, psychiatric illness, cardiac conduction disorders, or allergy to quinine or quinidine. atovaquone/proguanil (malarone) is a combination pill taken once daily with food starting two days before arrival and continuing through the trip and for seven days after departure. side-effects, which are typically mild, may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, or dizziness. serious adverse reactions are rare. doxycycline is effective, but may cause an exaggerated sunburn reaction, which limits its usefulness in the tropics. primaquine may cause hemolytic anemia in those with g6pd deficiency, so a blood test documenting normal g6pd levels must be obtained before starting primaquine. in those with normal g6pd levels, the main side-effect of primaquine is gastrointestinal disturbance, which can be minimized by taking the medication with food.
