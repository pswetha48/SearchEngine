in summary, doxycycline and azithromycin were found to be highly effective against both leptospirosis and scrub typhus. both drugs were also effective as an initial empirical treatment for patients who presented with acute fever without an obvious focus of infection, and no bacterial infection was evident after admission. azithromycin is an appropriate alternative antimicrobial treatment in areas where doxycycline-resistant scrub typhus is prevalent and also for children under 8 years old or during pregnancy, where doxycycline is contraindicated. azithromycin was better tolerated than doxycycline but it is more expensive (approximately 10$ versus 2$ per treatment course) and less readily available. we thank the doctors, nurses, and medical technologists of udonthani hospital, maharaj nakhon ratchasima hospital, chaiyapoom hospital, ban mai chaiyapod hospital, and chumphon hospital for their cooperation and help during the study period.
