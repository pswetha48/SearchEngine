a new york city physician who worked with doctors without borders treating ebola patients in west africa is in stable condition friday after testing positive for the virus a day earlier, city health officials said. he is the fourth case confirmed in the united states. the 33-year-old emergency room doctor, craig spencer, returned from guinea more than a week ago and reported coming down with a 100.3-degree fever and diarrhea on thursday. city health commissioner mary travis bassett said spencer had no temperature elevation before thursday morning — so it’s not likely he was contagious before then.
