south africa has revised the entry and exit rules for those travelling with children. the south african department of home affairs has advised the new rules are to protect children from trafficking, abduction and kidnapping. the implementation of these new rules has been postponed until 1 june 2015. the new rules will apply from 1 june 2015 and are applicable to all children under 18 years old: those travelling into or out of south africa with children may be asked to produce unabridged birth certificates reflecting the details of both parents/guardians, as well as a valid passport for each child. this requirement applies even when both parents/guardians are travelling with their children. where only one parent/guardian is accompanying, they may be asked to produce parental or legal consent for each child to travel, such as an affidavit from the other parent, a court order or � if applicable � a death certificate. there are additional requirements for children travelling unaccompanied or with adults who are not their parents/gurdians.
