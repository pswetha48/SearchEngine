ebola cells appear to concentrate in the liver, but its most damaging effect is on the cells lining the blood vessels. the virus disables the immune system, which allows it to replicate undetected. in addition, it compromises cells so they become less functional around the blood vessels, causing those blood vessels to leak. this is the source of dehydration before long, the virus kills the blood vessels and as it replicates inside the cell, it makes the cell explode. eventually, your own immune system will attack every organ in your body. you will slowly bleed to death.
