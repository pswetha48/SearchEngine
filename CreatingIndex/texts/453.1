a person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. in an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person that contaminates water and/or food. the disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. the disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another; therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk for becoming ill. cholera infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. approximately one in 20 (5%) infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. in these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. without treatment, death can occur within hours.
