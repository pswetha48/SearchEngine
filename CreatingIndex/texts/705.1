the texas capital city of austin notes on the austin/travis county health and human services department website that typhus has been reported in the austin/travis county area for the past several years and is now endemic to the austin area. as of september 11, 2013, 13 cases of typhus had been reported in travis county in 2013, most frequently reported from may through september. continues to investigate and monitor all reported cases of typhus. however, the texas department of state health services (dshs) infectious disease control unit reports that most murine typhus cases identified in texas occur in south texas from nueces county southward to the rio grande valley, with a few cases reported in other parts of the state each year. the dshs says the apparent increase in the number of typhus cases reported in texas can be attributed to active surveillance for typhus being conducted in the border counties between 2006 and 2009; and beginning in 2008, typhus expanding into new areas. also, increased awareness of murine typhus in the medical community in these new areas contributed to a record number of cases being reported in 2011.
