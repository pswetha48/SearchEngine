a person gets malaria when bitten by a female mosquito who is looking for a blood meal and is infected with the malaria parasite. the parasites enter the blood stream and travel to the liver, where they multiply. when they re-emerge into the blood, symptoms appear. by the time a patient shows symptoms, the parasites have reproduced very rapidly, clogging blood vessels and rupturing blood cells.
