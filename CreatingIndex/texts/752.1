the list of diseases for which quarantine or isolation is authorized is specified in an executive order of the president. this list currently includes cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers (lassa, marburg, ebola, crimean-congo, south american, and others not yet isolated or named), severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), and influenza caused by novel or reemergent influenza viruses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic. isolation would last for the period of communicability of the illness, which varies by disease and the availability of specific treatment. usually it occurs at a hospital or other health care facility or in the person's home. typically, the ill person will have his or her own room and those who care for him or her will wear protective clothing and take other precautions, depending on the level of personal protection needed for the specific illness. in most cases, isolation is voluntary; however, federal, state and local governments have the authority to require isolation of sick people to protect the public.
