severe malaria occurs when infections are complicated by serious organ failures or abnormalities in the patient's blood or metabolism. the manifestations of severe malaria include cerebral malaria, with abnormal behavior, impairment of consciousness, seizures, coma, or other neurologic abnormalities severe anemia due to hemolysis (destruction of the red blood cells) hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine) due to hemolysis acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), an inflammatory reaction in the lungs that inhibits oxygen exchange, which may occur even after the parasite counts have decreased in response to treatment abnormalities in blood coagulation low blood pressure caused by cardiovascular collapse acute kidney failure hyperparasitemia, where more than 5% of the red blood cells are infected by malaria parasites metabolic acidosis (excessive acidity in the blood and tissue fluids), often in association with hypoglycemia hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). hypoglycemia may also occur in pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria, or after treatment with quinine.
