ebola virus is a nonsegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded rna virus that resembles rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses in its genome organization and replication mechanisms. it is a member of the family filoviridae, taken from the latin "filum," meaning thread-like, based upon their filamentous structure. in the past, ebola and marburg viruses were classified as "hemorrhagic fever viruses", based upon their clinical manifestations, which include coagulation defects, bleeding, and shock. however, the term "hemorrhagic fever" is no longer used to refer to ebola virus disease since only a small percentage of ebola patients actually develop significant hemorrhage, and it usually occurs in the terminal phase of fatal illness, when the individual is already in shock
