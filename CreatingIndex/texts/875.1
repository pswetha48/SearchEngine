ebola would become a pandemic when it hits india. we are a poor country with health systems that are already stretched in the �season� of disease. we have one nurse per 1,000 people (according to 2010 world bank data) compared to 1.6 nurses that nigeria has or the 10 nurses that the u.s. has for 1,000 people. the u.s. has systems and adequate resources to effectively track and isolate victims of ebola, and the people these victims could have infected, to stem the tide of the epidemic. most importantly, they have a far lower population density. imagine a tracking-and-quarantine operation in dharavi in mumbai or egmore in chennai. our best course of action is prevention. prevent all persons originating from the three hardest-hit nations � guinea, sierra leone and liberia � from coming into india, no matter what their status (health or otherwise). pre-boarding scrutiny of passports will accomplish this. if and when the epidemic intensifies, extend that ban to persons from nigeria too. also, how many indian healthcare workers are working in nigeria, sierra leone, guinea and liberia? has due care (quarantine for instance) been exercised when they have returned to india?
