the bacteria which cause endemic and epidemic typhus are not transmitted directly by bites, but by contamination of the bite site with infected louse faeces which are then inoculated by human excoriation. they then parasitise the endothelial cells of blood vessels, causing a multisystem vasculitis. orientia tsutsugamushi is transmitted by the ovaries of trombiculid mites. the offspring infected mites are known as chiggers, and pass the infection directly to humans. this mainly occurs in cooler regions of africa, south america and asia. during the 1990s, there were outbreaks in burundi, russia and peru. outbreaks occur where poverty, homelessness, close human contact and lack of opportunity for washing and laundry co-exist, favouring the person-to-person spread of the human body louse. tick-associated reservoirs of r. prowazekii have been described in ethiopia, mexico and brazil. epidemic typhus is considered a potential bioterrorism agent and was tested as such in the former ussr during the 1930s
