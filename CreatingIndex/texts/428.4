we believe that ebola�s first offensive maneuver is the targeting of certain types of immune cells which would normally be our body�s first line of defense against illness. another major factor in the ebola virus�s system wide attack on the body is its ability to form blood clots. forming small clots early on, the virus causes the patient�s blood to slowly thicken, resulting in a decreased blood flow. another more serious effect of the ebola virus�s clotting factor is the decreased blood supply to the vital areas of the body such as the liver, brain, kidneys, lungs, intestines, testicles and extremities.
