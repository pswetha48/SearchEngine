first, the period of infection is very small. within two to 14 days, anyone who is exposed to it will get it. and two, a country like india does not have any history of his virus and if this virus is imported in any form or there is an indigenous outbreak, people will not have immunity against it. they have not been exposed to this virus earlier so their body does not have immunity against it. as i have said, because the case-fatality rate is very high, the morbidity and mortality rate will be very high. now, how is ebola transmitted? it spreads via body fluids ï¿½ saliva, sweat, semen, blood and physical contact. the risk of exposure to those who are handling ebola cases, health care workers, for instance, is very high.what we need to do is try and stop importation of the virus into india and if there is importation, we should be able to isolate and quarantine such a patient. the best way to do that is put check points at the entry points like airports and sea ports. for some time, people should avoid non-urgent travel to west african countries and to the middle east. this will minimise risk of importation.
