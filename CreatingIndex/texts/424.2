ebola virus was first recognized in 1976 in zaire (now the democratic republic of congo) in an outbreak that affected 318 people and resulted in 280 deaths. the virus and its five subtypes belong to a family of viruses called filoviridae; only four of the five subtypes have caused disease in humans. the virus affects humans and non-human primates, but the natural reservoir of ebola remains unknown. this means the exact origin and natural habitat of the virus are a mystery, with significant implications for treatment and prevention
