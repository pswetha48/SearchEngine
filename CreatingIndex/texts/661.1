as the disease spread west to hamburg, all ships from baltic ports were put under quarantine. those arriving in london had to spend ten days in standgate creek, near deptford, before a doctor gave the ship a clean bill of health, 'the last three days of this period to be bona fide employed under proper supervision in opening hatches .... and ventilating the spaces between decks by windsails, and opening, airing and washing the sailors' clothes and bedding.' vessels from sunderland were put in quarantine by the end of november 1831, soon after the cholera had arrived there. the measures were not completely effective because the first cases in london occurred on the river, mostly on colliers from the tyne. during december and january there were a large number of cases of suspected cholera in london, and the prospect of an epidemic received a lot of attention. john james, a ship scraper two days off the elizabeth from sunderland, was the first death ashore, in rotherhithe on 11 february. north of the river the first case was that of sarah ferguson, taken ill on the afternoon of sunday 12 february. she was quickly moved from white's rents, nightingale lane, to limehouse workhouse, where she died eight hours later. her extremities turned a blue colour shortly before death, confirming this was the 'asiatic' or 'blue' cholera. another woman, mary shea, and her daughter caroline, were taken ill at the same time and both died. all three were buried as soon as possible in deep graves in the corner of the churchyard.
