the bacteria target epithelial cells and microfold cells of the small intestine in the distal ileum in close proximity to the the peyer's patches, which are important lymphoid tissue in the gut. much like the other salmonella serovars discussed previously, salmonella typhi employs a type iii secretion system to inject proteins into the host cell, altering its cytoskeletal structure and inducing the uptake of the bacterium into the cytoplasm of the host cell. however, this serovar's pathogenicity is more invasive. because of the location of infection in the small intestine, salmonella typhi typically invades the peyer's patches and thereby accesses the lymphatic system, which ultimately leads to more widespread dissemination by way of the general circulation. once in circulation, these salmonellae can target cells in multiple organ systems. most importantly, they infect macrophages, in which they replicate and are able to disseminate throughout the reticuloendothelial system.
