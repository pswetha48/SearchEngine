if the ebola virus is able to replicate a lot, what happens is that the patient isn�t able to mount an immune response. then the leakiness of the blood vessels and also the destruction of the blood vessels � which leads to some of the bleeding that is commonly associated with ebola � takes over and the person can�t function. their liver stops working. often their kidneys stop working. and then they can�t put up a defense any more, and the virus just keeps on replicating.
