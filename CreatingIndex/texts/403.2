(reuters) - federal health officials on monday revamped guidelines for doctors and nurses returning home to the united states from treating ebola patients in west africa, stopping well short of controversial mandatory quarantines being imposed by some u.s. states. dr. thomas frieden, director of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), called for voluntary home quarantine for people at the highest risk for ebola infection but said most medical workers returning from the three countries at the center of the epidemic would require daily monitoring without isolation.
