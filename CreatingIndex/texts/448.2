patients with ebola have had about a 50 percent survival rate, but the chance of survival increases when the virus is diagnosed early. the symptoms begin with fever, then worsen into severe diarrhea and vomiting, causing dehydration. because no specific medication exists, intervention methods that involve what medical professionals call "supportive therapy" can keep the disease from getting even more severe. they include inserting an iv and balancing electrolytes. they also maintain oxygen, sometimes with a tube, and monitor blood pressure. if other infections occur they treat them. as the disease gets worse, kidney and liver function can be impaired, and a patient can begin bleeding both inside and outside the body.
