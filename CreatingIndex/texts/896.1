from the beginning of time, mankind has coexisted with war, disease, and famine. there is also fear in america, and in some respects, it seems oddly misplaced. from 1918 to 1922, typhus and the spanish flu killed 53 million people around the world. each year, tb, cholera, malaria, and aids kill millions as well. what is surprising is that last week, a new $40 million amusement park opened in a damascus suburb, while militants control the suburbs on the other side of syriaï¿½s capital. then, over the weekend, i saw a photo of a shopping mall in turkey that was 45 minutes from kobane. one would think it would be millions of miles from the siege, as massacres serve as an exclamation point from isis.
