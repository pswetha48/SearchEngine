malaria is one of the major causes of preventable death in the world today. it affects more than 500 million people worldwide and causes 1 to 2 million deaths every year. it is a tropical disease. therefore, it is rare in the united states and european countries, where almost all cases are seen in people who have traveled from countries where malaria is common. in the tropics, the particular species of plasmodium varies from country to country. in some areas, new strains of malaria have emerged that are resistant to some antimalarial drugs. this emergence of drug-resistant strains has complicated the treatment and prevention of malaria in tropical countries and in travelers.
