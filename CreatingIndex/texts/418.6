atlanta's emory university hospital got the first call at the end of july. an american doctor who'd been treating ebola patients in liberia was now terribly sick with the virus himself. in just 72 hours, dr. kent brantly would be coming through emory's doors. then, almost immediately, the staff learned that a second ebola patient was also on the way. dr. jay varkey's first thought was, "what do we need today, in order to care for these patients tomorrow?"
