your heart bleeds into itself; the heart muscle softens and has hemorrhages into its chambers, and blood squeezes out of the heart muscle as the heart beats, and it floods the chest cavity. the brain becomes clogged with dead blood cells, a conditions known as sludging of the brain. ebola attacks the lining of the eyeball, and the eyeballs may fill up with blood: you may go blind. droplets of blood stand out on the eyelids: you may weep blood. the blood runs from your eyes down your cheeks and refuses to coagulate. you may have a hemispherical stroke, in which one whole side of the body is paralyzed, which is invariably fatal in a case of ebola.
