most cases are treated with doxycycline (100 mg po bid for 5 days) or cholramphenicol (500 mg qid po for 7-10 days) or ciprofloxacin (750 mg bid po for 5 days). mortality from untreated typhus fever is up to 15% (3). in this case, we treated the patient with ceftriaxone for typhoid fever. we did not treat the patient with doxycycline, chloramphenicol, or ciprofloxacin because of high liver enzymes but monitored for any clinical deterioration of symptoms from typhus. the patient was asked to return one week after discharge to receive a second course of antibiotics for typhus.
