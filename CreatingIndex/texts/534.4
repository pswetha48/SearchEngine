ebola destroys the brain more thoroughly than does marburg, and ebola victims often go into epileptic convulsions during the final stage. the convulsions are generalized grand mal seizures -- the whole body twitches and shakes, the arms and legs thrash around, and the eyes, sometimes bloody, roll up into the head. the tremors and convulsions of the patient may smear or splatter blood around. possibly this epileptic splashing of blood is one of ebola's strategies for success -- it makes the victim go into a flurry of seizures as he dies, spreading blood all over the place, thus giving the virus a chance to jump to a new host -- a kind of transmission through smearing.
