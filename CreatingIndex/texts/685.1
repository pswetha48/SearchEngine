after these initial symptoms of ebola, the fever often progresses to cause more serious ones: diarrhea, dark or bloody feces, vomiting blood, red eyes due to distention and hemorrhage of sclerotic arterioles, petechia, maculopapular rash and purpura. there is often gastrointestinal bleeding from the mouth and rectum, sometimes leading to the sloughing of the gut and venting from the anus. internal and external hemorrhage from orifices, such as the nose and mouth, may also occur. as the virus progresses, bleeding in the brain can lead to severe depression, seizures and delirium.
