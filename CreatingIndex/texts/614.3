falciparum malaria is far more severe than other types of malaria because the parasite attacks all red blood cells, not just the young or old cells, as do other types. it causes the red blood cells to become very "sticky." a patient with this type of malaria can die within hours of the first symptoms. the fever is prolonged. so many red blood cells are destroyed that they block the blood vessels in vital organs (especially the kidneys), and the spleen becomes enlarged. there may be brain damage, leading to coma and convulsions. the kidneys and liver may fail.
