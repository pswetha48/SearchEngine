typhus fever is endemic in the foothills of central lac. in 1997, cases occurred in alhambra (2), bellflower (1), foothill (2), glendale (1), northeast (5), and san fernando (1) health districts. ninety-two percent of reported cases were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days the nonspecific clinical presentation and the lack of a definitive test during the acute phase of the illness make the early diagnosis of murine typhus difficult. thus, diagnosis of murine typhus depends on the clinical acumen of the treating physician, and is often confirmed after the patient has recovered. accurate reporting of typhus or suspect typhus cases is important to identify endemic areas in lac which can be monitored for the presence of disease in the animal populations and to institute control measures. treatment with antibiotics hastens recovery and lessens the chance of complications.
