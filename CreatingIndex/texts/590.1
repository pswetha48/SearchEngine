scrub typhus responds promptly to effective treatment, with patients becoming a febrile within 24 to 48 hours. this was previously considered as an aid for the diagnosis as most therapies in the field are empiric; and failure of a rapid clinical response often suggests another diagnosis or presence of antibiotic resistance. early administration of treatment shortens the disease course, reduces mortality and accelerates convalescence, although early studies suggested that initiation of tetracycline therapy before day 5 of illness are associated with relapses 5 to 10 days after therapy (28). to date, none of the laboratory tests for the diagnosis have been shown to be useful for monitoring the follow-up, including serology or molecular methods. reinfection with o. tsutsugamushi is frequent in endemic areas but acquired immunity is incomplete. immunity with homologous strains may last for up to several years, but immunity to heterologous strains decreases after several weeks even if the disease is usually milder.
