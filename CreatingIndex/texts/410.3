last week, new jersey gov. chris christie (r) and new york gov. andrew cuomo (d) announced that people who had treated ebola patients in africa would be quarantined for three weeks when they returned to the u.s., even if they didnï¿½t show symptoms of the virus. after facing waves of criticism from public health experts -- and outrage from a healthy nurse quarantined in a tent behind a new jersey hospital -- the governors relaxed the policies, saying people could serve out their quarantines at home. several other states have announced similar quarantine plans.
