malaria caused an estimated 207 million cases and 627,000 deaths in 2012, mostly young children in sub-saharan africa. it contributes to poverty; in africa alone, costs of illness, treatment, and premature death from malaria are at least $12 billion per year. malariaï¿½s toll would be much higher without the efforts of cdc and other global partners. from 2000 through 2012, the massive scale-up of malaria prevention and treatment interventions saved approximately 3.3 million lives globally, and malaria death rates in africa were cut nearly in half. however, malaria remains a major public health problem, even though it is both preventable and treatable. malaria is spread by the bite of a female anopheles mosquito. the disease can cause fever, chills, and flu-like illness. if it is not treated, it may cause severe complications and death.
