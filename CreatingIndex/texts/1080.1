fatality is approximately ninety percent with ebola zaire, and sixty percent with ebola sudan. no fatality rate has yet been determined for ebola tai, as only one known human has been infected--a swiss scientist who contracted it from a chimpanzee but recovered successfully. as aforementioned, ebola reston is believed to be only hazardous to primates, and therefore has no human fatality rate as of yet either.
