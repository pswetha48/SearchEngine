in addition, what is known about ebola is that it requires a known marker that aids in bringing the virus from the surface of the cells into the cells. researchers have found in a laboratory setting that some people's cell lines actually lack this marker, or it may be mutated somehow, so that the ebola can't get into the cells. however, ebola research is still very much in its infancy, and knowledge about how the virus behaves is still evolving, bhadelia said.
