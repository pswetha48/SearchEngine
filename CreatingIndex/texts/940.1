the threat of rickettsial diseases to australian defence force (adf) personnel is reviewed, focusing on the historical impact and epidemiology of these diseases. scrub typhus, a mite borne disease caused by orientia tsutsugamushi is historically the most important rickettsial disease, and continues to cause morbidity in adf personnel today. the historical occurrence of tick typhus, murine typhus, epidemic typhus and q fever has been limited, and modern diagnostic tools and antibiotic therapy mean that their impact is minimal. deployment of troops to endemic areas, bioterrorism and exposure during humanitarian missions mean that rickettsial diseases will remain a threat to adf personnel.
