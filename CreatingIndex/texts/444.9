the natural reservoir for ebola has yet to be confirmed; however, bats are considered to be the most likely candidate species.[34] three types of fruit bats (hypsignathus monstrosus, epomops franqueti and myonycteris torquata) were found to possibly carry the virus without getting sick.[53] as of 2013, whether other animals are involved in its spread is not known.[52] plants, arthropods and birds have also been considered possible viral reservoirs.
