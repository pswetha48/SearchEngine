robert whyte, pseudonymous author of the 1847 famine ship diary: the journey of a coffin ship,[3] described how on arrival at grosse isle the irish emigrant passengers on the ajax dressed in their best clothes and helped the crew to clean the ship, expecting to be sent either to hospital or on to quebec after their long voyage. in fact, the doctor inspected them only briefly and did not return for several days. by midsummer, 2500 invalids were quarantined on grosse isle, and the line of waiting ships stretched several miles. at the end of july, dr. douglas abandoned the quarantine regulations because they were 'impossible' to enforce and doctors were examining their charges very perfunctorily, allowing them to walk past and examining the tongues of any who looked feverish. in this way, many people with latent fever were allowed to pass as healthy, only to succumb to their sickness once they had left grosse isle.
