in the malaria-endemic world, diagnosis of malaria can be difficult for several reasons: malariaï¿½s clinical symptoms are shared with other diseases and conditions, and many malaria-endemic countries lack resources, such as microscopes and rapid diagnostic tests, to make a definitive diagnosis. health personnel in these areas are often undertrained, underequipped and underpaid. health personnel in the malaria-endemic world often face excessive patient loads, and must divide their attention between malaria and other equally severe infectious diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, tuberculosis, and hiv/aids.
